Feature: Merge Articles More
  As a blog administrator
  In order be avoid similar duplicate articles from multiple bloggers
  I want to be able to merge articles on my blog

  Background:
    Given the blog is set up
    And I am logged into the admin panel

  Scenario: When articles are merged, the merged article should have one author (either one of the authors of the two original articles).
    Given I am on the home page
    When I follow "Merge Me 1 Merge Me 2 Combined"
 	Then I should see "admin"
	And I should not see "asprose"

  Scenario: Comments on each of the two original articles need to all carry over and point to the new, merged article.
    Given I am on the home page
    When I follow "Merge Me 1 Merge Me 2 Combined"
	Then I should see "Gloomy"
	And I should see "Peppermint"

  Scenario: The title of the new article should be the title from either one of the merged articles.
    Given I am on the home page
    When I follow "Merge Me 1 Merge Me 2 Combined"
	Then I should see "Merge Me 1 Merge Me 2 Combined"
